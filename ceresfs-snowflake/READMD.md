# Snowflake

This is a java version of [Twitter Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake). 

Twitter Snowflake is a network service for generating unique ID which requiring twitter's infrastructure service. We prefer Snowflake a simple java library rather than a network service so it can be embbed in any network service.

## Usage

```java
Snowflake snowflake = new Snowflake.Builder(serverId).build();
long id = snowflake.nextId();
```

## Configure

The ID generated by Snowflake is composed of:

* 41bits for millisecond precision time (69 years)
* 10bits for a configured server identity (1024 server)
* 12 bits for a sequence number (4096 per server*milliseconds)

You can adjust the bits according to the actual situation.

```java
Snowflake snowflake = new Snowflake.Builder(serverId, serverIdBits)
        .setSequenceBits(sequenceBits)
        .setEpoch(epoch)
        .build();
long id = snowflake.nextId();
```
